Task1: Retrieve all the articles relevant to a given text query in **Data-1**.
    
    What I Understood From the Problem ?
   -> In this task, we have been given a data set of all the information. Now, given a query, we have 
      to return the articles that are related to the query. For this, we have calculated the similarity
      between the query and the full articles of every row of the data set using Cosine Similarity and 
      returned the full articles having good similarity score. 


    Algorithm Used :

    Step 1. Parse CSV file and convert it into list.
    Step 2. Select full article column from each row of the list and store it in a newly created set.
    Step 3. Append the given query in the same set.
    Step 4. Find similarity score between given query and each full article which returns similarity score matrix.
    Step 5. Convert the obtained matrix into list.
    Step 6. Create new JSON document which stores the score and the full article corresponding to every score in the matrix.
    Step 7. Sort the JSON document and show the number of results as required.
